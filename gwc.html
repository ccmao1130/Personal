			The first week, we learned Scratch. Scratch is a visual programming language. It's kind of like an introduction to computer science and coding because the program provides you with every command you are allowed to you and the program tells you how each thing works. Scratch serves as a good introduction because it allows beginner programmers to explore and experiment with simple contents of computer science. Learning Scratch in general is pretty easy, but for me it was even easier because I already learned Scratch as school. In our computer science class at School, we learned <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html" target="_blank">SNAP!</a>, which is an online alternative to Scratch, for a whole semester, or half a school year, therefore I am pretty familiar with it.

			One of our projects with Scratch was making a jukebox that would play songs in the order the user chooses. My partner and I made a Taylor Swift themed jukebox that contained the songs: You Belong With Me, Love Story, Bad Blood, and Blank Space. It was fun but also frustrating because when we finished programming it all, or at least that's what we thought, and tested it, all the songs would play at the same time. It was more like a mashbox than a jukebox. Fortunately, it all worked out in the end and we had ourselves a little Taylor Swift party.

		<h2 id = "week2">Week 2: Python (July 5 - July 8)</h2>
			<div class = "content1">
			<p>
			The second week, we learned a, more "official," programming language called Python. Python is a programming language that has a very easy to read syntax, which is why it is also a good language for beginner programmers. Python's standard library is made up many built-in functions that come with the language when it is installed. However, many other libraries can be downloaded from the internet that allowed users to do more with Python.

			<h3>July 20 - SIMS and Maxis Tour</h3>
				<p class = "p2">
				Today, we got to learn about the process of a SIMS game, from creating an idea to launching the entire game. We learned about design, animation, engineering, production, launching, and marketing. After learning about the entire process, we had to create an idea for a possible expansion pack for SIMS, draw everything out, and present our idea to our class and several SIMS employees. At the end, we got a great surprise! The SIMS employees gave everyone a SIMS drawstring bag. Inside the bag was a SIMS lanyard, a white moleskine notebook with a SIMS4 logo on it, a headband with a SIMS diamond that lights up, and a couple of games. The games included SIMS4 (base game), SIMS 4 Get to Work (expansion pack), and SIMS 4 Get Together (expansion pack). I feel very spoiled because we got all of this stuff for free! All in all, I really enjoyed having the opportunity to learn about the entire process of making a game and being able to experience it.
