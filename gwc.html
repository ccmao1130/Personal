				<p>
				The first week of Girls Who Code was fun. Though, for me at least, it was kind of boring just because I already learned Scratch at school. In our computer science class at Hillsdale, we learned SNAP!, which is an online alternative to Scratch, for half a year, so I am pretty familiar with it. One of our projects with Scratch was making a jukebox that would play songs in the order the user chooses. It was fun but frustrating because at first all the songs would just play the same time.

				<h3>July 20 - SIMS and Maxis Tour</h3>
					<p class = "p2">
					Today, we got the learn about the process of a SIMS game, from creating an idea to launching the entire game. We learned about design, animation, engineering, production, launching, and marketing. After learning about the entire process, we had to create an idea for a possible expansion pack for SIMS, draw everything out, and present our idea to our class and several SIMS employees. At the end, we got a great surprise! The SIMS employees gave everyone a SIMS drawstring bag. Inside the bag was a SIMS lanyard, a white moleskine notebook with a SIMS4 logo on it, a headband with a SIMS diamond that lights up, and a couple of games. The games included SIMS4 (base game), SIMS 4 Get to Work (expansion pack), and SIMS 4 Get Together (expansion pack). I feel very spoiled because we got all of this stuff for free! All in all, I really enjoyed having the opportunity to learn about the entire process of making a game and being able to experience it.
